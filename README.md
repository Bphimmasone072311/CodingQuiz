CODING QUIZ
 
 This program allows you to take a coding quiz that will document each question with a timer of 10seconds and record each answer. 
 Each question will have a red or green circle to signafy if the answer is correct or not. At the end of the quiz, your score 
 will be calculated and presented at the end. GOOD LUCK!
